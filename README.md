<!-- ABOUT THE REPO -->

## About The Repo

This repo contains practice exercises for the fundamental JavaScript concepts of prototype methods and scope. There are two directories to explore. The original practice folder was created during the learning process. The revisited practice folder was created to solidify foundational JavaScript concepts after more advanced learning. Each directory has corresponding folders for each concept with a README that includes instructions for solving each type of problem.
